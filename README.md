# profilepicchooser

Profilepicchooser is a simple block for Moodle that allows users to choose a profile picture from a bank of premade avatars.
The block has a simple button that, when clicked, opens a modal window and allows the user to choose their new avatar.  It works similarly to "Netflix" and how users can choose a login picture from a bank of their favourite Netflix characters from popular TV shows.

**Installation**
Copy it to your Moodle "/blocks" folder to install it.
Or install via this Git Repo

**Warranty and Support**
This plugin was a concept plugin for a new project. I may not have time to support and maintain it. So, if you use it, bear this in mind. Also, if you fork it and modify it. Then that's also fine.
