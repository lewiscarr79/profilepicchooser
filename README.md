<h1>About</h1>
Profilepicchooser is a simple block for Moodle that allows users to choose a profile picture from a bank of premade avatars.
The block has a simple button that, when clicked, opens a modal window and allows the user to choose their new avatar.  It works similarly to "Netflix" and how users can choose a login picture from a bank of their favourite Netflix characters from popular TV shows.

<h1>Installation</h1>
Copy it to your Moodle "/blocks" folder to install it.
Or install via this Git Repo
Or install via the plugin uploads directly from within Moodle

<h2>License</h2>
As this plugin is built for Moodle, it is provided freely as open-source software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

<h2>Version Compatability</h2>
Build for Moodle 4.3+ (but it should work in future versions also)

<h2>Warranty and Support</h2>
This plugin was a concept plugin for a new project. I may not have time to support and maintain it. So, if you use it, bear this in mind. Also, if you fork it and modify it. Then that's also fine.

<h2>About the images</h2>
The images used for the plugin were generated using AI from freepik.com.  You are OK with using them but will likely want to change them to use your own.
To do this, replace the images in the /profilepics folder with your own. Keep the same filenames.
