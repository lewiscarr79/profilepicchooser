<h1>About</h1>
Profilepicchooser is a simple block for Moodle that allows users to choose a profile picture from a bank of premade avatars.
The block has a simple button that, when clicked, opens a modal window and allows the user to choose their new avatar.  It works similarly to "Netflix" and how users can choose a login picture from a bank of their favourite Netflix characters from popular TV shows.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Copy it to your Moodle "/blocks" folder to install it.
Or install via this Git Repo
Or install via the plugin uploads directly from within Moodle

<h3>License</h3>
As this plugin is built for Moodle, it is provided freely as open-source software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

<h4>Version Compatability</h4>
Build for Moodle 4.3+ (but it should work in future versions also)

<h5>Warranty and Support</h5>
This plugin was a concept plugin for a new project. I may not have time to support and maintain it. So, if you use it, bear this in mind. Also, if you fork it and modify it. Then that's also fine.
